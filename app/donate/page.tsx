              Since the Taliban's takeover in August 15, 2021, Afghan women and girls have been systematically excluded from education.
            </p>

            <p>
              Secondary schools remain closed. Universities ban women. Female teachers have lost their livelihoods.

            <p className="font-medium text-black">
              Despite these oppressive measures, Afghan women continue to resist through secret schools and digital learning.
